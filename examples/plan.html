<p>This incident response plan is based on the concise, directive, specific, flexible, and free plan available on Counteractive Securityâs <a href="https://github.com/counteractive/incident-response-plan-template">Github</a> and discussed at <a href="https://www.counteractive.net/posts/an-ir-plan-you-will-use/">www.counteractive.net</a></p>
<p>It was last reviewed on {{REVIEW_DATE}}. It was last tested on {{TEST_DATE}}.</p>
<p><code>TODO: Customize this plan template for your organization using instructions at https://github.com/counteractive/incident-response-plan-template.

<h1 id="assess">Assess</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Stay calm and professional.</strong></li>
<li>Gather pertinent information, <em>e.g.</em>, alarms, events, data, assumptions, intuitions (<strong>observe</strong>).</li>
<li>Consider impact categories, below (<strong>orient</strong>), and determine if there is a possible incident (<strong>decide</strong>):</li>
<li>Initiate a response if there is an incident (<strong>act</strong>). If in doubt, initiate a response. The incident commander and response team can adjust upon investigation and review.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assess-functional-impact">Assess Functional Impact</h2>
<p>What is the direct or likely impact on your mission? (<em>e.g.</em>, business operations, employees, customers, users)</p>

<li>None: assess information impact.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assess-information-impact">Assess Information Impact</h2>
<p>What is the direct or likely impact on your information/data, particularly anything sensitive? (<em>e.g.</em>, PII, proprietary, financial, or healthcare data)</p>
<ul>
<li>Information accessed, taken, changed, or deleted: <strong>incident!</strong></li>
<li>None: handle via non-incident channels (<em>e.g.</em>, support ticket).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Every team member is empowered to start this process.</strong> If you see something, say something.</p>

<li>Prefer voice call, chat, and secure file exchange over any other methods.</li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> use primary email if possible. If email is necessary, use sparingly or use {{ALTERNATE_EMAIL}}. Encrypt emails when any participant is outside the {{ORGANIZATION_DOMAIN}} domain. <code>TODO: Add alternative email details and procedure, e.g., on-demand Office 365 or GSuite</code></li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> use SMS/text to communicate about the incident, unless to tell someone to move to a more secure channel.</li>

<ul>
<li>Choose <strong>immediate</strong> remediation when it is more important to immediately stop attacker activities than to continue investigating. For example, ongoing financial loss, or ongoing mission failure, active data loss, or prevention of an imminent significant threat.</li>
<li>Choose <strong>delayed</strong> remediation when it is important to complete the investigation, or important not to alert the attacker. For example, long-term compromise by an advanced attacker, corporate espionage, or large-scale compromise of an an unknown number of systems.</li>

<p>Assign steps to individuals or teams to work concurrently, when possible; this playbook is not purely sequential. Use your best judgment.</p>
<h3 id="investigate-1">Investigate</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Immediately take the defaced server offline for further investigation
<ul>
<li>This is especially important if the defacement is insulting or triggering in any way. Remove this from the public eye as quickly as possible to avoid harm as well as to mitigate business impact.</li>
<li>The defacement message may also contain false information that could mislead users or put them at risk.</li>
<li>Taking the server offline will allow a deeper investigation of the defacement. This may be necessary as the hacker may have dove depper into the organization accessing application servers, databases, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Determine the systemâs source of vulnerability that was used by the attacker. Common exploits include:
<ul>
<li>SQL injection attakcs
<ul>
<li>This kind of attack occurs when an attacker interferes with an applicationâs queries to the database. Therefore, this can lead to unauthorized access to private or sensitive data. Read more about SQL injection attacks <a href="https://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/sql-injection/">here</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks
<ul>
<li>This kind of attack exploits an applicationâs referencing function to upload malware from a remote URL. Read more about RFI attacks <a href="https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/remote-file-inclusion-rfi/">here</a></li>
</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>other methods of detection include:
<ul>
<li>Checking the server logs
<ul>
<li>look through the web pageâs access log and error log for any suspicious or unfamiliar activity</li>
<li>of course, it is also a good idea to check the IDS or IPS firewall logs, if available</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Checking files with static content</li>
<li>Scanning databases for malicious content</li>
<li>Checking links present in the page</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Collect any clues as to who the hacker is or what organization they are working for. Consider the following questions:
<ul>
<li>What did the defacement portray? Did it include an obvious message?</li>
<li>Did the defacement seem harmless or intentional? Could the hacker be a kid messing around or a professional group working with a motive?</li>
<li>Does it seem like your organization was targeted? Who may want to target your organization?</li>
<li>What did the hacker hope to accomplish?</li>
<li>Consult <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-hackers/">here</a> to learn more about the types of hackers that may have attacked your webpage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Collect other important information from the page that has been defaced such as:
<ul>
<li>a screenshot of the defacement</li>
<li>the domain and IP address of the page</li>
<li>details of the web server</li>
<li>pageâs source code
<ul>
<li>analyze this carefully to identify the problem and ensure that it is on a server belonging to the company</li>
</ul></li>
<li>name or any information on the attacker</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are also tools available to aid in both detection and log analysis. A few are listed below:
<ul>
<li>Weblog Expert</li>
<li>Sawmill</li>
<li>Deep Log Analyzer</li>

<h3 id="remediate-1">Remediate</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan remediation events</strong> where these steps are launched together (or in coordinated fashion), with appropriate teams ready to respond to any disruption.</li>
<li><strong>Consider the timing and tradeoffs</strong> of remediation actions: your response has consequences.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>TODO: Customize containment steps, tactical and strategic, for website defacement.</code></p>
<p><code>TODO: Specify tools and procedures for each step, below.</code></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Backup all data stored on the web server for forensic purposes.</li>
<li>As previously mentioned, make sure to take the defaced pageâs server down temporarily while investigation occurs.
<ul>
<li>You should have an error page prepared for this situation that informs user and/or employees that maintenance is undereway and the page they sought will return shortly. You may even wish to have a backup website prepared where you may publish content while investigation and remediation are underway and have your temporary error page redirect users to this backup site.</li>
<li>Check your network architecture map. If the breach is another system on the network, take that down and investigate it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once the source of the attack has been determined, apply the necessarily steps to ensure this will not happen again. This may include modifying code or editing access rights.
<ul>
<li>Reference the âInvestigateâ section for common sources of vulnerability.</li>
<li>If this is outside of your domain, simply ensure that you have given the appropriate personnel all the information on the attack that you have and allow experts to do their job.</li>

<h3 id="recover-1">Recover</h3>
<p><code>TODO: Customize recovery steps for defacement</code></p>
<p><code>TODO: Specify tools and procedures for each step, below</code></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Remove the hackerâs message and replace with original, legitimate content. If data was lost in the attack, reference backups and restore the original page as much as possible.
<ul>
<li>Check backups for indicators of compromise</li>
<li>Consider partial recovery and backup integrity testing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consider asking users to change their login credentials if the web server has user authentication.</li>
<li>After implementing risk avoidance measures (as recommended below), restore your server showing the original page content.</li>
<li>If necessary and/or applicable, prepare an apology/explanation of the attack that occurred for users or anyone who witnessed the defacement. Ensure that is it clear that the defacement content does not reflect your organization in any way.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="risk-avoidance">Risk Avoidance</h4>
<p><code>TODO: Communicate with other employees to ensure that everyone understands and contributes to the following steps, where applicable</code></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use as few plug-ins as necessary. Hackers target websites that are vulnerable and have many sources of entry. You can limit these sources of entry by only using what you need and removing any unused or old plug ins and software. It is also important to update these as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Closely monitor and mandate access to administrative content. Only allow individuals access to what they need access to. This will reduce the chance of human error leading to cyber attacks. There are more DIY methods of prevention mentioned in <a href="https://cirt.gy/index.php/node/116">this article</a> (steps 6-12) and in resource #4 at the end of this playbook.</li>
<li>Regularly check for malware on your site by scanning the source code. Look for scripts, iframes, or URLs that look unfamiliar and make sure to also scan URLs that do look familiar.</li>
<li>There are many highly reputable automated website scanners that will not cost any of your time and will thoroughly scan your site for vulnerabilities regularly. Here is a <a href="https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/14-popular-web-application-vulnerability-scanners/#gref">link to popular scanners</a>.</li>
<li>Defend against common points of exploitation such as SQL injections and XSS attacks. <a href="https://www.banffcyber.com/knowledge-base/articles/best-practices-address-issue-web-defacement/">This article</a> includes best practices to defend these attacks.</li>
<li>Install defacement detection programs so that if an attack were to occurr again, you would be prepared and respond quickly. Here is an <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-website-defacement-monitoring-service">article</a> that summarizes some of 2020âs best monitoring services.</li>

<li><a href="#role-deputy-incident-commander-deputy">Deputy Incident Commander</a></li>

<li>External Liaison</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Operations Team

<li><a href="#role-subject-matter-expert-sme">Subject Matter Experts</a> (SMEs) for Systems</li>
<li>SMEs for Teams/Business Units</li>
<li>SMEs for Executive Functions (<em>e.g.</em>, Legal, HR, Finance) During larger complex incidents, the role structure may be adjusted to account for the creation of sub-teams. Read about how we handle <a href="/before/complex_incidents.md">complex incidents</a> for more information.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a <strong>flexible structure</strong>: every role will not be filled by a different person for every incident. For example, in a small incident the Deputy might act as the Scribe and Internal Liaison. The structure is flexible and scales based on the incident.</p>
<h2 id="wartime-vs.-peacetime">Wartime vs.Â Peacetime</h2>
<p>On incident response calls (âwartimeâ), a different organizational structure overrides normal operations (âpeacetimeâ):</p>
<ul>
<li>The Incident Commander is in charge. No matter their rank during peacetime, they are now the highest ranked individual on the call, higher than the CEO.</li>
<li>Primary responders (folks acting as primary on-call for a team/service) are the highest ranked individuals for that service.</li>
<li>Decisions will be made by the IC after consideration of the information presented. Once that decision is made, it is final.</li>
<li>Riskier decisions can be made by the IC than would normally be considered during peacetime.</li>
<li>The IC may go against a consensus decision. If a poll is done, and 9/10 people agree but 1 disagrees. The IC may choose the disagreement option despite a majority vote. Even if you disagree, the ICâs decision is final. During the call is not the time to argue with them.</li>
<li>The IC may use language or behave in a way you find rude. This is wartime, and they need to do whatever it takes to resolve the situation, so sometimes rudeness occurs. This is not personal, and something you should be prepared to experience if youâve never been in a wartime situation before.</li>
<li>You may be asked to leave the call by the IC, or you may even be forcibly kicked off a call. It is at the ICâs discretion to do this if they feel you are not providing useful input. Again, this is not personal and you should remember that wartime is different than peacetime.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="role-all-participants">Role: All Participants</h2>

<ul>
<li>Follow instructions from the incident commander.</li>
<li>Do not perform any actions unless the incident commander has told you to do so.</li>
<li>The commander will typically poll for strong objections before tasking a large action. Raise objections if you have them.</li>
<li>Once the commander has made a decision, follow that decision (even if you disagreed).</li>
<li>Answer any questions the commander asks you in a clear and concise way. Answering âI donât knowâ is acceptable. Do not guess.</li>

<h2 id="role-incident-commander-ic">Role: Incident Commander (IC)</h2>
<h3 id="description-1">Description</h3>
<p>The Incident Commander (IC) acts as the single source of truth of what is currently happening and what is going to happen during an major incident. The IC is the highest ranking individual on any incident call, regardless of their day-to-day rank. They are the decision maker during an incident; they delegate tasks and listen to subject matter experts to resolve the incident. Their decisions made as commander are final.</p>
<p>Your job as an IC is to evaluate the situation, provide clear guidance and coordination, recruiting others to gather context/details. <strong>Do not perform any investigation or remediation:</strong> delegate these tasks.</p>
<h3 id="duties-1">Duties</h3>
<p>Resolve the incident as quickly and as safely as possible using the incident response plan as a framework: lead the team to investigate, remediate, communicate. Use the Deputy to assist you, and delegate to relevant liaisons and experts (SMEs) at your discretion.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Help prepare for incidents,
<ul>
<li>Setup communications channels for incidents.</li>
<li>Funnel people to these communications channels when there is a major incident.</li>

<ul>
<li>Get everyone on the same communication channel.</li>
<li>Collect information from team members for their services/area of ownership status.</li>
<li>Collect proposed repair actions, then recommend repair actions to be taken.</li>

<li>Spin off sub-teams</li>
<li>Transfer command when necessary</li>
<li>Sign off calls</li>
<li>Maintain order</li>
<li>Get straight answers</li>
<li>Handle executive swoop such as
<ul>
<li>Overriding the Incident Commander</li>
<li>Anti-motivation</li>
<li>Information requests</li>
<li>Questioning severity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Handle disruptive or belligerent responders</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Post Mortem,
<ul>
<li>Creating the initial template right after the incident so people can put in their thoughts while fresh.</li>
<li>Assigning the post-mortem after the event is over, this can be done after the call.</li>
<li>Work with Team Leads/Managers on scheduling preventive actions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>The Incident Commander uses some additional call procedures and lingo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always announce when you join the call if you are the on-call IC.</li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> let discussions get out of hand. Keep conversations short.</li>
<li>Note objections from others, but your call is final.</li>
<li>If anyone is being actively disruptive to your call, kick them off.</li>
<li>Announce the end of the call.</li>
<li>After an incident, communicate with other training Incident Commanders on any debrief actions you feel are necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use clear terminology, and avoid acronyms or abbreviations. Clarity and accuracy is more important than brevity.</strong></p>
<h3 id="training-1">Training</h3>
<ul>
<li>Read the incident response plan, including all roles and playbooks.</li>
<li>Participate in an incident response exercise.</li>
<li>Shadow a current incident commander without actively participating, keeping your questions until the end.</li>
<li>Reverse shadow a current incident commander. Respond to incidents with the current IC there to take over if necessary.</li>
<li><em>OPTIONAL:</em> facilitation training</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h4>
<p>There is no seniority or business-unit prerequisites to become an Incident Commander, it is a role open to anyone with the training and ability. Before you can be an Incident Commander, it is expected that you meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent verbal and written <strong>communication skills</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>High-level knowledge</strong> of business infrastructure and functions.</li>

</ul>
<p>Deep technical knowledge is not required! Incident Commanders do not require deep technical knowledge of our systems. Your job as Incident Commander is to coordinate the response, not make technical changes. Donât think you canât be an Incident Commander just because youâre not in the engineering department.</p>
